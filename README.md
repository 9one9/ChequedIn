In a small group of 6, my team had approached the MEAN stack as a way to create a simple messaging system. The goal was to make a RESTful client to deliver correspondence between employees in a company. MongoDB was put aside in favor of MySQL as that allowed for a more traditional table management. (We used JSON.stringify in JS) For a service layer Node and express made for a very reliable service layer on our local machines. The project went very well, and as a group, we were able to send and retrieve our messages with minimal delay. This project was placed into version control with Git, adding a great convenience to the process.
